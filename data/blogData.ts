      "<h2>Introduction</h2><p>JavaScript closures are a fundamental concept that every developer should understand. This article breaks down closures and their applications in web development.</p><h2>What is a Closure?</h2><p>A closure is a function that has access to its own scope, the scope of the outer function, and the global scope. This allows for the function to remember and access variables from the outer function even after the outer function has executed.</p><h2>How Closures Work</h2><p>Closures work by preserving the scope chain at the time of the function creation. This means that the inner function retains access to the variables and parameters of its outer function.</p><h2>Practical Applications</h2><p>Closures are useful in various scenarios, such as:</p><ul><li>Data Privacy: Encapsulate data and restrict access to it.</li><li>Callback Functions: Retain access to variables within asynchronous callbacks.</li><li>Function Factories: Create functions with preset arguments.</li></ul><h2>Examples of Closures</h2><p>Here are some examples of closures in action:</p><pre><code>function createCounter() {<br />  let count = 0;<br />  return function() {<br />    count += 1;<br />    return count;<br />  };<br />}</code></pre><p>In the above example, the inner function retains access to the 'count' variable even after the outer function has executed.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Mastering closures will improve your JavaScript skills and help you write more efficient and maintainable code.</p>",
